OpenRC is a dependency based init system that works with the system provided init program, 
normally located at /sbin/init. It is not a replacement for /sbin/init. OpenRC is 100% 
compatible with Gentoo init scripts, which means you can probably find one for the dozens of 
daemons in the main Gentoo repository.
